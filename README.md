<h3>About the Project</h3>

Quest is a web platform designed to help students and busy adults spend less time deciding what to play and more time actually playing.

Instead of getting overwhelmed by endless choices, users can easily organize their game backlog by creating custom lists such as Want to Play, Currently Playing, or any category they prefer. Quest makes managing and jumping into games simple, fast, and enjoyable.
